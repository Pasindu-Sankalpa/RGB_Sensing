# RGB Color Sensor

In this project, we have to designed and implemented a colour sensor
that can detect the colour on a surface and outputs its R, G, and B values.

## Description

We should calibrate at the beginning. This is able to handle alterations in lighting conditions. It is having the following modes.
1. Calibration mode
2. Sensing mode
3. RGB mode (A mode to light a RBG LED for user given R, G, and B values.)

Furthermore it is consist of,
1. An LDR
2. A keypad
3. An LCD display
4. PCB design
5. An enclosure deisgn
6. ATMega 328p chip
